Timber studs, joists or 'I' beams, for example, may only have a short survival time if exposed to fire and may rely on linings, such as a plasterboard ceiling, for fire-resistance. Services passing through such linings should therefore be fire-stopped."

        "explanation": "Neighbours outside the site are an important part of the wider environment. They may be affected by nuisance (such as noise, dust or even light at night), and they may complain to the client, main contractor or the local enforcing authority. Creating certain types of nuisance is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act."

        "question_number": 14,
        "question": "From an environmental point of view, why should materials be reused, where possible?",
        "options": {

        "question": "Which action will help to minimise waste?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is good practice, since it will help with waste recovery. If the waste is classified as hazardous waste (special waste in Scotland) proper segregation is also a legal requirement."

          "D": "Only during site clean-up, at the end of the project"

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Your actions will help your company, and others on site, to procure sensibly and to organise the job so that materials and substances are not wasted. Waste reduction is the best option when trying to manage site waste."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Although reducing the amount of waste is the first priority, the reuse of waste materials is much better than disposal, which is the most expensive option and which should be the last resort. Reuse is a better waste management option than recovery."

        "question_number": 19,
        "question": "Why should different types of waste be separated on site?",
        "options": {
          "A": "It will take up less room in the skip",
          "B": "So the local council can charge Landfill Tax",
          "C": "So the main contractor can check what's being thrown away",
          "D": "So waste can be recovered more easily"
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is good practice, since waste recovery can save both energy and materials, compared to creating brand new materials or items. It will also cut the amount of waste that goes to landfill. If the waste is classed as hazardous (special waste in Scotland) then the effective separation of different wastes is a legal requirement."

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The use of a bund (fully walled storage area) or a drip tray will help any spillage to be contained in a small area for clear up. Any spillage could get into the ground or drains, which is likely to be an offence under environmental legislation."

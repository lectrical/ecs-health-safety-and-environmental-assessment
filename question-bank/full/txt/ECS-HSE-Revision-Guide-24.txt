QUESTION 6.33

The purpose of fire-stopping in a building is to:

A. Prevent a fire starting
B. Delay the passage of fire and smoke through openings in walls and floors
C. Activate fire sprinklers
D. Set off the fire alarm

Right Answer: B

Fire-stopping is a passive fire protection measure used to seal any openings created in a fire resistance-rated wall or floor assembly, e.g. to allow pipes or wiring systems to pass through. During fire conditions this will impede the spread of fire and smoke.

QUESTION 6.34

What are fire-stops designed to do?

A. Extinguish a fire
B. Protect services (such as wiring systems) against fire damage
C. Close fire doors automatically
D. Delay the passage of fire and smoke through openings in walls and floors

Right Answer: D

Fire-stops are designed to maintain the fireproofing of a wall or floor assembly. Fire-stopping delays the spread of fire and, generally, the spread of smoke as well.

QUESTION 6.35

In addition to preserving fire separation between areas of a building, which other important fire safety function can fire-stopping achieve?

A. Preventing premature structural collapse
B. Reducing nuisance fire alarms
C. Reducing noise transmission
D. Saving energy

Right Answer: A

During a fire it is essential that the load-bearing capacity of elements of the building structure are maintained until occupants have escaped. Timber studs, joists or 'I' beams, for example, may only have a short survival time if exposed to fire and may rely on linings, such as a plasterboard ceiling, for fire-resistance. Services passing through such linings should therefore be fire-stopped.

QUESTION 6.36

Intumescent materials used to provide fire-stopping are designed to:

A. Expand when subjected to smoke
B. Shrink when subjected to heat
C. Expand when subjected to heat
D. Prevent noise transmission

Right Answer: C

A limited number of fire-resistant materials may be used to provide fire-stopping. These include intumescent products, which are designed to expand and provide fire-stopping when subjected to heat. Examples include intumescent 'pillows'.

QUESTION 6.37

What should you do if you disturb fire-stopping around a wiring system penetrating a wall or floor whilst carrying out work?

A. Nail a piece of wood over any gaps
B. Ensure that the fire-stopping is reinstated to the necessary standard as soon as possible
C. Highlight this on any certification
D. Fill any holes or gaps with squashed newspaper

Right Answer: B

It is essential that the integrity of fire compartments is maintained during the construction of buildings and on their completion. Compromising compartmentation, such as failing to adequately fire-stop (seal) openings for services to pass through, can undermine fire precautions catastrophically. Only a limited range of products are suitable and they must be correctly applied to provide the required degree of fire-stopping.

QUESTION 6.38

If you discover a hole or gap in a fire rated wall or floor that has not been fire-stopped, what should you do?

A. Report it to your supervisor without delay
B. Ignore it unless it is causing a draught
C. Cover the hole or gap with insulating tape
D. Use decorators' sealant to fill the gap

Right Answer: A

Supervisors need to be made aware of any observed inadequacies in fire-stopping - which can undermine fire precautions catastrophically during the construction of buildings and on their completion. Only a limited range of products are suitable and they must be correctly applied to provide the required degree of fire-stopping.

A. Make sure there is a label on it
B. Put it in a plastic bag and put it in a skip
C. Check whether someone else on your team can make use of it
D. Weigh it

Right Answer: C

Although reducing the amount of waste is the first priority, the reuse of waste materials is much better than disposal, which is the most expensive option and which should be the last resort. Reuse is a better waste management option than recovery.

QUESTION 11.19

Why should different types of waste be separated on site?

A. It will take up less room in the skip
B. So the local council can charge Landfill Tax
C. So the main contractor can check what's being thrown away
D. So waste can be recovered more easily

Right Answer: D

This is good practice, since waste recovery can save both energy and materials, compared to creating brand new materials or items. It will also cut the amount of waste that goes to landfill. If the waste is classed as hazardous (special waste in Scotland) then the effective separation of different wastes is a legal requirement.

QUESTION 11.20

When storing liquids (such as oils, fuels or chemicals) on-site, what must you do?

A. Always use the nearest container
B. Use a transparent container so you can check how much liquid is in it
C. Ensure the liquid material is stored safely and securely, and out of the way of site traffic
D. Keep the tops off, to prevent pressure from building up

Right Answer: C

QUESTION 11.21

What can help to prevent harm to the environment from oil spillages?

A. A supply of water to flush the spill away
B. Cover the spillage with soil
C. Turning liquid containers upside down so the top can't come off
D. Store oils in an area that can catch any spills, such as a bund or a drip tray.

Right Answer: D

The use of a bund (fully walled storage area) or a drip tray will help any spillage to be contained in a small area for clear up. Any spillage could get into the ground or drains, which is likely to be an offence under environmental legislation.
